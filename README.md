# WunderLINQ Example Android App

This app provides a simple example on how to obtain performance data from the WunderLINQ and how to use the control input.

The WunderLINQ Example app is for use with the [WunderLINQ Hardware](https://www.wunderlinq.com)

The WunderLINQ is a combination of Plug-and-Play hardware that snaps into your existing BMW Motorcycle 
Navigation Prep and a companion app for your Android or iOS phone or tablet.  Together they allow you

If your motorcycle also has the On Board Computer Pro option the WunderLINQ can also receive and 
decode performance and fault data.
